        <p className="privacy-text">
          <h4> Welcome to GameOver!</h4> <br />
          GameOver Games, Inc. is headquartered in Cary, North Carolina. We and
          our subsidiaries have offices and operations located around the world
          that help create and deliver some of your favorite products and
          services, including games like Fortnite and development tools like
          Unreal Engine (see “Our Global Operations” below). <br /> <br />
          This privacy policy describes the different ways we may collect, use,
          and share information on, through, or in connection with the GameOver
          Services (see “What are the GameOver Services?” below). If you have
          any questions, you can always reach out to us as described in “Contact
          Us” below. <br /> <br />
          When we refer to GameOver (or any similar terms like “we” or “us”) in
          this privacy policy, we mean the GameOver Games entity that controls
          and is responsible for your information, including GameOver Games,
          Inc. and its subsidiaries that help provide and support the GameOver
          Services. You can also find details about the data controller for
          personal information we collect through different GameOver Services in
          “Contact Us” below.

          1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
        </h1>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with
          us. Generally speaking, we collect information in three main ways: A)
          when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the GameOver
          Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.
        </p>
        <h2 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          A. Information You Provide
        </h2>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on
          how you interact with the GameOver Services. Sometimes we’ll ask you
          to provide specific pieces of information, such as when we require it
          to provide parts of the GameOver Services to you (for example, by
          prompting you to provide your date of birth or complete an online
          registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in
          these cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the
          relevant GameOver Services and/or some features may not operate as
          intended. <br /> <br /> For instance, in order to make purchases on
          the GameOver Store and to play some of our games, you’ll need a
          GameOver account. To create one, you’ll need to provide us with basic
          registration information like your name, a public-facing display name,
          password, the country you live in, and email address. If you want to
          make a purchase, we may ask you to provide payment-related information
          (like your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the
          transaction. In addition, many of our services require your date of
          birth to determine which features we can offer you and which settings
          to apply to your account based on your age and location. <br /> <br />
          We also collect the information you voluntarily provide to sign up for
          email alerts, use social features like forums or chat, register for
          early access to our games, use our developer tools (including to
          create and publish games and other content), enable two-factor
          authentication, register for or attend our events, complete surveys,
          or contact us through Player Support requests or customer service. If
          you use our voice chat feature and voice reporting is enabled in a
          voice channel, snippets of voice chat audio data will be stored on
          your device and the devices of participants in the voice channel. If a
          violation of our Community Rules is reported, these snippets may be
          transmitted to GameOver to help us enforce those Community Rules. If
          you enter a contest or competitive event, or participate in our
          Support-A-Creator or Island Creator programs, we’ll collect your
          application information and other information we may need to help
          confirm your eligibility and process payouts. We collect whatever
          information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar
          cases.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          B. Information We Collect Automatically
        </h2>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or
          use the GameOver Services. This includes information about your
          gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other
          activity in the GameOver Services, that are typically associated with
          your account (if you are logged into your GameOver account or use a
          third-party account to access the GameOver Services) or with an
          identifier we have assigned to your device or profile. While the
          specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary,
          they generally include: <br /> <br /> • Usage information and
          statistics about how you interact with the GameOver Services,
          including the application you used or the game you played, how long
          you used or played it and when, gameplay attempts, progression and
          results, saved preferences, crash reports, the URLs of our websites
          that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page
          views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, and platform type;{" "}
          <br /> <br /> • Technical information about your computer, device,
          hardware, or software you use to access our services, such as IP
          address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins,
          or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such
          as device make and model, information about device operating systems
          and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications); and{" "}
          <br /> <br /> • The general location of your device, which we
          typically derive from your device’s IP address. <br /> <br /> The
          GameOver Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web
          beacons to automatically collect the types of information listed
          above. Some of these technologies may create small files or
          record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device. They help us,
          our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and
          provide information about how you use and interact with the GameOver
          Services. For example, they support our ability to authenticate users,
          remember preferences, manage advertising, personalize experiences, and
          conduct data analytics. <br /> <br /> Please note that if certain
          features on the GameOver Services are provided by third parties, those
          third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may
          record information about your use of the GameOver Services, their
          services, or others’ websites over time. For example, when you use
          GameOver Services (like Unreal Engine) that include third-party
          software, those third-party providers may collect information through
          their technology. These features are subject to those third parties’
          privacy notices and policies.
        </p>
        <h2 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          Information We Collect from Other Sources
        </h2>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          In some cases, we may also receive information about you from service
          providers and third parties in connection with your use of the
          GameOver Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.{" "}
          <br /> <br /> For example, some other developers allow you to use your
          GameOver account to log in to their service. And if you choose to link
          your GameOver account with your account on a third-party social media
          (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or
          service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the GameOver
          Services on an external website or service, the company that operates
          that website or service may share some information with GameOver in
          accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on
          the other company’s website or service typically control the specific
          types of information they can share with GameOver, so please be sure
          to review and update them regularly. Common examples for linked
          accounts might include your third-party account display name and user
          ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.
          For participants in our Support-a-Creator program, we may also collect
          the number of social media account followers you have for program
          eligibility purposes. <br /> <br /> You can also buy, download, or
          access some GameOver Services on or through services operated by third
          parties. If you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate
          your access to and use of the GameOver Services. This typically
          includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and
          region information. For example, you can choose to download and play
          games like Fortnite on gaming consoles (like PlayStation®, Microsoft
          Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account. When
          you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some
          information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your
          gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.
        </p>
        <h2 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          D. Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat
        </h2>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on
          the GameOver Services is extremely important to us. We strictly
          enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and
          any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the GameOver
          Services. We use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention
          technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These
          services may collect and analyze data about your computer and the
          software on your computer to detect cheating and may be provided by
          GameOver or by service providers.
        </p>

        <h1 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          2. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?
        </h1>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          As a general matter, we use the information we collect (either
          individually or in combination with other information collected as
          described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize,
          analyze, and promote the GameOver Services. <br /> <br /> This
          includes using it for purposes such as: <br /> <br /> • Creating,
          verifying, and managing user accounts and features; <br /> <br /> •
          Providing the GameOver Services, as well as support and assistance for
          them, including by responding to inquiries, processing transactions or
          requests, and communicating with users (such as by sending service and
          account-related messages and updates); <br /> <br /> • Developing,
          delivering, and improving the GameOver Services and other offerings,
          some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties; <br />{" "}
          <br />
          • Personalizing your experience, including by presenting content or
          features better tailored to you or your interests, or our inferences
          about your interests (for instance, if you frequently play games in a
          certain genre, we may infer that you’d be interested in that genre and
          suggest similar games to you); <br /> <br /> • Promoting the GameOver
          Services, including managing, customizing, and measuring the
          effectiveness of our advertisements, promotional offers, surveys, and
          events; <br /> <br /> • Managing alpha, beta, or early access tests
          (and collecting feedback); <br /> <br /> • Conducting data analytics
          (like analyzing how the GameOver Services are used so we can better
          understand, improve, and personalize them); <br /> <br /> • Complying
          with our legal or contractual obligations and enforcing our terms;{" "}
          <br /> <br /> • Securing the GameOver Services, such as by detecting
          fraud and otherwise protecting GameOver and other users from illegal
          or harmful actions; and <br /> <br /> • Improving technologies or
          processes used to accomplish these purposes (like training machine
          learning models used to help detect or moderate toxic, illegal, or
          harmful content or conduct and enforce our terms and policies like our
          Community Rules). <br /> <br /> We may also process information that
          does not identify you individually, including aggregate or
          de-identified information that we create or collect from other
          sources. This information helps us better understand larger groups of
          users. If we combine this information with information that identifies
          you, we will treat it as described in this privacy policy. But please
          note that this privacy policy does not restrict our ability to process
          information that does not individually identify you, and we may use
          and disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any reason
          permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h1 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          3. SECURITY
        </h1>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical
          safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental,
          unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access,
          disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing. In some
          cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we
          offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and
          password confidential and secure so that your information is
          protected. If we become aware of unauthorized disclosure of your
          personal information, we will notify you as required by law and take
          steps to help secure your information.
        </p>
        <h1 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          4. UPDATE
        </h1>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          We’ll update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
          practices or relevant laws. When we do, we’ll change the date noted at
          the top of the policy. In some cases, we may also notify you of the
          relevant changes by email or within the GameOver Services. Please
          review this policy regularly to make sure that you understand your
          relationship with GameOver and the ways we may collect, use, and share
          information in connection with the GameOver Services.
        </p>
        <h1 className="privacy-title" style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
          5. RETENTION
        </h1>
        <p className="privacy-text">
          Because the specific personal information we process and our reasons
          for doing so often vary depending on how you use the GameOver
          Services, how long we retain it can also vary. We generally store
          personal information for as long as we reasonably need it for the
          purposes described in this policy (like complying with our legal
          obligations, managing internal records, enforcing our terms, and
          resolving disputes), unless a long retention period is required or
          permitted by law. <br /> <br /> The main criteria we consider in
          determining specific retention periods often include minimum
          requirements under applicable law, relevant industry standards, the
          types of data in question (such as its level of sensitivity),
          relevance to potential litigation or similar proceedings (like
          defending ourselves against legal claims), and whether the data is
          required to prevent fraud or similar abuse of the GameOver Services
          (including to enforce prohibitions against cheating and other
          unauthorized behavior). For example, if you create a GameOver account,
          we will generally store the personal information associated with your
          GameOver account for as long as needed to maintain your account,
          provide the GameOver Services you requested, enforce any terms that
          apply and govern your use of the GameOver Services, and maintain
          appropriate records to reflect how we deliver the GameOver Services to
          you. <br /> <br /> To learn more about requesting that GameOver delete
          your personal data, please see “Your Choices and Controls” and “Data
          Subject Rights” above.
