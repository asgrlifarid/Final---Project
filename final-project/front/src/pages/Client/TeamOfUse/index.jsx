          The Customer does not have the right to publish in closed and open
          communication channels (aside of its own corporate communication
          channels), transfer and/or resell to any third party the data and
          results of all the Services received from the Service Provider. <br />{" "}
          <br /> The publication of the received data with the obligatory
          indication of the source of such data is possible only after
          establishing a written agreement with the Service Provider. <br />{" "}
          <br /> Otherwise, if such data is published in the media, the Internet
          or provided to the public in any other way by the Customer or third
          parties that have received the results of the Services provided by the
          Service Provider, the Customer will be responsible for such
          publication or distribution. <br /> <br /> For the act of
          non-compliance with the previous clause, the Customer may be fined a
          hundred times the cost of the Service. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the
          Service Provider has a right of legal action to cease rights
          infringement immediately, without prior consultation with the
          Customer. <br /> <br />
          In the case of a poor-quality, or incomplete or untimely provision of
          the Services by the Service Provider, the Customer must contact the
          Service Provider by contacting the Service Provider’s support service
          at info@escharts.com. <br /> <br />
          Such a letter should indicate the specific problem, the contact
          details of the Customer and data on payment. To clarify the nature of
          the problem, the support service may also request other types of
          information. <br /> <br /> The Service Provider reserves the right to
          refuse to provide the Services to the Customer without explanation.
          <br /> <br /> All the claims regarding the quality of the Services
          provided must be sent by the Customer to the Service Provider by
          e-mail to SUPPORT@escharts.com. The time for consideration of the
          Customer’s claim(s) by the Service Provider is 30 (thirty) calendar
          days (except claims containing a request for a refund) from the moment
          the claim is received by the Service Provider, after which the Service
          Provider takes one of the following decisions: 1) a decision on
          disagreement with the claim and denial of a refund, or 2) a decision
          of consent to the claim and the satisfaction of the claim for a
          refund. <br /> <br /> The User has a guaranteed right to a refund of
          the funds paid for the subscription exclusively on condition that no
          more than 24 hours have passed since the moment of payment, and no
          more than 20 pages of the Esports Charts online service have been
          visited from the User's account. This also applies to the automatic
          renewal of the subscription, in which case 24 hours start counting
          from the moment the funds are credited to the Service account in the
          payment system. <br /> <br />
          The following services are not eligible for a refund under any
          circumstances: Events Dashboard, Teams Dashboard, Social Dashboard,
          and API Products. Due to the nature of these services, and by

          of funds, the funds shall be returned to the Customer by crediting
          them to the Customer’s account, credit card, personal account,

          e-mail. The parties unconditionally accept that the final decision on
          the method of returning funds remains in each case at the discretion
          of the Service Provider. The funds shall be credited to the bank
          account indicated by the Customer within 30 calendar days from the
          moment of the Service Provider's receival of the signed and scanned
          application of the Customer in the prescribed form. A financial
          document confirming the payment of funds by the Service Provider to
          the Customer’s account is proof of the fulfillment by the Service
          Provider of the obligation to return funds to the Customer, which is
          unconditionally accepted by the parties.
